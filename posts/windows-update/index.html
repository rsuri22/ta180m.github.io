<p><em>Originally posted on my <a href=https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/blog/src/branch/main/_posts/2021-01-06-windows-update.md>old blog</a></em></p>
<p>If I had to name the single thing that I most hate about Windows, it would probably be Windows update. I have a long and complicated history with Windows update. Throw in <a href=https://insider.windows.com/>Windows Insider</a>, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster!</p>
<h2 id=a-close-encounter>A close encounter</h2>
<p>So my experience with Windows update begins about two or three years ago, when I noticed the cute ninja cat of Windows Insider lounging at the bottom of the Updates panel in the Windows 10 settings app. (Check for yourself! It&rsquo;s a ninja cat.) Curious, I clicked on it, and I was piqued by the thought of &ldquo;exploring new Windows features&rdquo; and such. Well, they say curiousity killed the (ninja) cat, and my first Insider build that I installed wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most stable thing. Yeah, I got a GSOD (I completely freaked out) and hurriedly reverted back to a regular build. Anyways, I stayed away from Insider for a while.</p>
<h2 id=the-disaster-really-begins>The disaster really begins</h2>
<p>Eventually, stories about Insider&rsquo;s spectacular WSL 2 support drew me back, and soon, I was back on an Insider build. <a href=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/04/08/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-19603/>19603</a> to be exact. Ironically, WSL 2 was added to regular Windows not long after, but anyways, 19603 was surprisingly stable. No crashes. No GSODs. Maybe a few minor graphical glitches occasionally, but I was enjoying WSL 2.</p>
<p>Then, new stories emerged. OpenGL GPU support in WSL 2! Or some combination of buzzwords to that effect. I was hooked. I needed that new Insider build, number <a href=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/07/01/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20161/>20161</a>. (Actually, GPU support might have been added in a previous build, but I didn&rsquo;t hear about it until after they released 20161) And 20161 was, as you might expect, pretty unstable. I think I got at least three GSODs during a few days of usage, so I impatiently waited for the next build to drop.</p>
<p>This was the one that killed my PC. Build <a href=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/07/29/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20180/>20180</a>. I don&rsquo;t know what happened. Maybe it was because I left Windows alone to update for a few hours, and came back to see it totally wrecked. Maybe it was because I used some <a href=https://github.com/Ta180m/Windows/blob/master/hyper-v.bat>DSIM hacks to enable Hyper-V on Windows Home</a>. Maybe my RAM had a memory error in the middle of the update. Maybe a bit flipped somewhere and derailed everything. But whatever the cause was, Windows was in a <em>very</em> bad shape after the update.</p>
<p>Yeah. That was one of the reasons, probably the most down-to-earth reason, why I switched to Linux. The USB ports started acting weirdly, I experienced popups telling me stuff was wrong with Task Manager, when installing software it would fail in the middle for no reason, and a lot more. My NVIDIA graphics card was no longer detected by Windows <code>DSIM</code> and <code>SFC /scannow</code> stopped working. When they said unstable, I didn&rsquo;t know this was what could happen.</p>
<p>I tried a lot of stuff. I tried searching up my problems online. No help. I tried to update Windows to the next build, but it kept on failing in the middle. No help. So, I did the logical thing: switch to Linux, and I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy ever since. No of the problems ever followed me to Linux. (Of course, the NVIDIA card gives me plenty of problems on Linux, but they aren&rsquo;t related to ones I was having with Windows)</p>
<p>But something was still bugging me. A few weeks ago, I recieved another email from Windows Insider telling me to update my build, since it was no longer going to be supported. If I didn&rsquo;t update by January 21 (or something like that) I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to boot up Windows!</p>
<p>I was stuck. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Reinstall Windows? I didn&rsquo;t want to go through the trouble. After all, I never use Windows except for the occasional gaming. So, I tried my last resort: Windows update.</p>
<h2 id=windows-update-to-the-rescue>Windows update to the rescue!</h2>
<p>Yes, Windows update, the very same thing that had crippled my PC. Many of the online guides had recommended trying to update Windows to solve some of the problems that I was having. Since my build was expiring, I decided that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to try, other than wasting two hours of my time.</p>
<p>I started by moving some large files out of my Windows partition to ensure there was sufficient space during the update. Then, I enabled the &ldquo;optional telementry&rdquo; that must be enabled for downloading Insider builds and got started. The update lasted around 90 minutes. It stalled for a while at certain percents several time, but it eventually completed. Somehow.</p>
<p>When it was done, I logged back in, and it did the usual &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; ritual. Finally, it dropped me back on to my desktop, and I tested a few things to see if my Windows installation had been fixed. Nothing suspicious or weird happened, which was definitely a relief. OK, so it looked good so far. It also felt a lot faster and smoother, but that was probably because I disabled Windows Defender. (I don&rsquo;t need it if I only use Windows to play a few games once a month)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on build <a href=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20279/>20279</a> for several days now. Since I rarely use Windows, I don&rsquo;t know the full extent of its stability or lack of stability, but it seems like <em>all</em> of my problems from before have been fixed. Weird.</p>
<p>One final observation: How come proprietary operating systems still take forever to do updates? Can&rsquo;t they learn from Linux? Why do they need to take 90 minutes even for updating from one build to the very next one? Sure, I can excuse it if it&rsquo;s one update every six months because a lot could have changed (Ubuntu version updates also take a while) but Windows shouldn&rsquo;t have needed 90 minutes for something like build 20161 to 20180. And that update seriously broke my computer. Well, it looks like my latest build 20279 won&rsquo;t expire until October, so I might just procrastinate the next update until then.</p>
