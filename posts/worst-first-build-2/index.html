<p><em>Originally posted on my <a href=https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/blog/src/branch/main/_posts/2021-03-03-worst-first-build-part-2.md>old blog</a></em></p>
<p>What a perfect time to build a PC: massive supply chain disruptions, cryptocurrencies driving up GPU prices through the roof, (scalper) bot wars, and a pesky little thing called the coronavirus murdering 2.5 million people (that last one probably sounds completely alien to anyone before 2019). Just perfect!</p>
<p>Anyways&mldr; for over 40 days since buying an overpriced 5600X (because of insane taxes, that&rsquo;s what), there were a grand total of zero deals. OK, fine, there were a few motherboards that were discounted a little bit, but nothing big. The drought of price drops literally desiccated my hope of being able to complete my build anytime soon at a reasonable price. My build was indefinitely on hold.</p>
<p>But then&mldr;</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m trying to build up suspense even though everyone knows what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Wait, let me first back up a bit and give some context: I had set up alerts for a ton of motherboards: cheap ones, high-end mainstream mobos, even ones I never though I would buy. I had my eye on the <a href=https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zsfFf7/asrock-b550-extreme4-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-extreme4>Extreme4</a> since it had been relatively cheap when I was planning my build, but the price simply refused to go down again.</p>
<p>The days went on, and no alerts were triggered. OK, some of them were, but they were all for really bad deals that only shaved off a few percent.</p>
<p>But nothing could have prepared me for a 40% price drop.</p>
<p>Yes, it was that delicious.</p>
<p>On the night of February 21, the price of the <a href=https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ZPDkcf/asrock-b550-pg-velocita-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-pg-velocita>PG Velocita</a> crashed over 40%. Ludicrous! I know! Instant buy!</p>
<p>I ended up snagging the mobo at around $132, nearly $90 lower than its MSRP, and even cheaper than the lowest price of the Extreme4. And this is no cheap mobo, with its stellar VRMs. According to reviews at least. I still have no idea how much pain it&rsquo;s going to take to actually get it to boot with the 5600X since at release, many motherboards needed a BIOS update for the new processors. Hopefully the BIOS on mine is compatible&mldr;</p>
<p>Anyways, AMD is announcing a new graphics card today. Yes, when all graphics cards are being sold at twice their MSRP. Perfect timing.</p>
