<p><em>Originally posted on my <a href=https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/blog/src/branch/main/_posts/2020-11-01-ios-jailbreaking.md>old blog</a></em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this &ldquo;episode&rdquo; style:</p>
<h2 id=episode-0-because-no-true-programmer-would-start-a-list-with-1>Episode 0 (Because no true programmer would start a list with 1)</h2>
<p>In fourth or fifth grade, a friend told me about all the cool things he was doing with his jailbroken iPhone.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY like your friend telling you about how fun and awesome competitive programming is.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t impressed.</p>
<h2 id=episode-1>Episode 1</h2>
<p>Five years later&mldr;</p>
<p>After doing some TI-Nspire, Wii U, and Switch hacking, I set my eyes on my lowly iPhone 6s with a cracked screen that I&rsquo;m procrastinating to fix. The time was ripe for some iOS jailbreaking!</p>
<p>Hacking a TI-Nspire, Wii U, or Switch involves going on GitHub and downloading some files. But for iOS jailbreaking, I was clueless on what to download, especially since there are so many different iOS jailbreaks, so I searched for &ldquo;iPhone 6s 12.1.4 jailbreak&rdquo;.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T DO THIS! You get a bunch of junk results like random YouTube videos, so I followed one and it was really sketchy. Like, extremely sketchy. I had to install a bunch of apps from the app store before the jailbreak could begin, and, well, it was sketchy.</p>
<p>Plus, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY like a weird, sketchy greedy algorithm that you doubt is going to work, and you implement it, but&mldr; it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<h2 id=episode-2>Episode 2</h2>
<p>Yeah, that didn&rsquo;t work. Let&rsquo;s try something else. So, I did some research, and found a different, actually legit jailbreak. But it was still sketchy, because I didn&rsquo;t know a thing about sideloading <code>.ipa</code>s, so I installed some kind of enterprise app thingy? DON&rsquo;T DO THIS! You&rsquo;ll get pwned instantly, so yeah, don&rsquo;t install untrusted and sketchy apps. Thankfully that hasn&rsquo;t happened to me yet&mldr; or maybe it has. Who knows.</p>
<p>But somehow, it worked!</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY like a weird, sketchy greedy algorithm that you doubt is going to work, and you implement it, but&mldr; it does work somehow.</p>
<p>And I could finally play WII SPORTS on my phone. YEEESSS!!!</p>
<h2 id=episode-3>Episode 3</h2>
<p>A few weeks later, I made the horrifying discovery that not only did I have to do the jailbreak again every time I rebooted my phone (I should have anticipated this one), but that the sketchy enterprise app I was using got taken down!</p>
<p>NOOOOOO!!!</p>
<p>Time to find another jailbreak&mldr;</p>
<p>So I did some research, and it seems like unc0ver is the leading iOS jailbreak. Fortunately, it supported my phone model and iOS version, so I proceeded to follow the instructions on their website. Unfortunately, AltStore, the preferred sideloading method these days doesn&rsquo;t work on iOS 12.1.4, so I considered my other options: Cydia Impactor, requiring an overpriced $99 Apple developer account, or Xcode.</p>
<p>The first option was obviously off the table, but the second was more interesting. The thing is, Xcode is macOS only, and I don&rsquo;t own any Apple computers.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I do have one, issued by my school, but it&rsquo;s extremely locked down. Also, I don&rsquo;t own it, the school does.</p>
<p>So, my only option was to set up a macOS VM.</p>
<p>I never liked VMs. They&rsquo;re slow, hog disk space, and NEVER work. But somehow, against all chance, it worked! I was able to get a macOS VM running slowly, but smoothly, on Windows using VMware Player. Unfortunately, my disk space reached critically low levels at that point, so I loaded up Xcode onto a USB drive.</p>
<p>And it worked! Somehow.</p>
<p>It took forever because the VM was so slow, but in the end, I could play WII SPORTS on my phone again!</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY like a complicated, convoluted, overkill algorithm that takes 10 hours to implement and somehow passes a few milliseconds under the time limit. Like maybe 2D segment tree, plus Aho-Corasick algorithm, plus heavy-light decomposition, plus divide-and-conquer DP or something, all in the same algorithm. But it works. Somehow.</p>
<h2 id=episode-4>Episode 4</h2>
<p>But my good luck didn&rsquo;t last. Fast forward another week, and Windows update murdered my USB drivers.</p>
<p>Yeah. That was one of the main reasons why I switched to Linux soon after. Not just that incident, but several other updates crippled my computer.</p>
<p>Since I had such a bad experience finally jailbreaking my phone with a macOS VM, I tried to keep it from shutting down for as long as possible.</p>
<p>But one day&mldr;</p>
<p>It ran out of battery.</p>
<p>NOOOOOO!!!</p>
<p>So, I started researching macOS VMs again. I tried every combination I could. VM on Linux using KVM, VM on Windows using VMware, VM on Windows using VirtualBox, VM on Linux using VMware, VM on Linux using VirtualBox&mldr;</p>
<p>But nothing worked. Even when the VM ran smoothly, it would always fail when I tried to do a USB passthrough for NO REASON.</p>
<p>Yeah. VMs suck.</p>
<p>I was going to tear my hair out and smash my iPhone with a hammer when I realized&mldr;</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY when your complicated, convoluted algorithm runs half a second over the time limit, after you&rsquo;ve taken 10 hours to implement it.</p>
<h2 id=episode-5>Episode 5</h2>
<p><img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/linux_user_at_best_buy.png alt="I use Linux!"></p>
<p>I use Linux!</p>
<p>Why am I trying to set up a macOS VM? Why am I trying to use the unc0ver jailbreak when there&rsquo;s like a million other ones?</p>
<p>So, I search this time for &ldquo;iOS jailbreak for Linux&rdquo; and sure enough, I got plenty of interesting and useful results. I tried the first result, the checkra1n jailbreak, downloaded it, and loaded it up on my computer.</p>
<p>Two minutes later&mldr;</p>
<p>I had accomplished it! It worked, obviously! After over 20 hours of sweat, blood, and toil with macOS VMs, I forgot to just take a step back, and look at my alternatives. Why did I keep on trying to drill into an infinite wall of bedrock, when the solution was just a few steps BEHIND me?</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY like when you&rsquo;re stuck on a programming problem for 10 hours because you&rsquo;ve been trying the same wrong thing over and over. But when you take a step back, and consider your other options, you realize the elegant solution wasn&rsquo;t that far away. Just in the other direction.</p>
<h2 id=epilogue>Epilogue</h2>
<p>iOS jailbreaking sucks. Just going to get that out of way. I&rsquo;m never buying an iPhone again, this experience was so bad.</p>
<p>So does the world sometimes. It sucks.</p>
<p><a href=https://codeforces.com/contest/1239/problem/B>The world is just a programming task.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing too many programming problems.</p>
