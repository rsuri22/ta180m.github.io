<p><em>Originally posted on my <a href=https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/blog/src/branch/main/_posts/2021-05-28-does-windows-really-suck.md>old blog</a></em></p>
<p>Well, obviously yes.</p>
<p>But recently, I heard about official support for <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps>GUI apps in WSL</a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. Plus, my computer is on the <a href=/posts/windows-update>Windows Insider dev channel</a>, so I have to boot up and update Windows every few months anyways.</p>
<p>So I booted up Windows for the first time in a few months, and it was&mldr; slow. That&rsquo;s all that I can describe it as. After you get used to the speed of KDE Plasma, Windows feels like an ill, lethargic sloth or something. It was painfully slow and my computer&rsquo;s fans spun at maximum volume much of the time. It didn&rsquo;t help that there was a ton of stuff that needed updating, and the whole process took at least an hour. At least I can update most of the crap apps through the Windows store&mldr; which is slower than Yuzu emulator. At least emulators have to try to run games at a reasonable speed; the Windows store just wastes as much of your time as possible while also bombarding you with stupid app recommendations on the home page. I also had to install some beta drivers for my GPU to support WSL, which required some Device Manager trickery to get it to work. For some reason, Firefox updated to a beta version, which looked gorgeous, but that&rsquo;s a story for another post.</p>
<p>Then I had to reboot to install the latest Windows update for WSL GUI apps, of course, and that took another hour.</p>
<p>Whew! Got that out of the way! I disabled Windows Defender, Office Click-to-run, and half a dozen other services that kept on using up all my CPU in the meantime using a variety of registry and CMD hacks. After I finished cleaning up Windows, it&rsquo;s time to enjoy WSL GUI apps!!</p>
<p>Except&mldr; they didn&rsquo;t work. I tried running <code>wsl --update</code> more times than I could count. Not wanting to waste more time, I nuked my WSL installation and reinstalled it from the stupid Windows store.</p>
<p>And then, finally, after all those hours, WSL GUI apps finally worked. It was very anticlimatic; basically the same thing as VcXsrv in its multiple windows mode, but with some extra perks.</p>
<p>I wish I took some screenshots, but I don&rsquo;t want to boot into Windows again and suffer more.</p>
<p>WSL is awesome, and I&rsquo;m sure a lot of work must have been put into making it so integrated. But the raw crap that is Windows prevents the experience from being very enjoyable, whether it&rsquo;s random Windows processes using up 100% CPU all the time, or taking two hours to update, or the general &ldquo;It just (doesn&rsquo;t) work™&rdquo; feeling that seemed to bog down the whole experience.</p>
<p>An interesting sidenote: <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wslg-architecture/>WSLg</a>, the graphics system for WSL, uses a VM of <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner>CBL-Mariner</a>, one of Microsoft&rsquo;s internal Linux distributions. With all the work being put into WSL, could that mean a consumer Linux distro from Microsoft is coming soon, and free us all from the trash that is Windows? We can only dream&mldr;</p>
