First things first, let&amp;rsquo;s generate a list of all official Arch Linux packages. Fortunately, pacman, the best pragmatic package manager in existence, makes this a breeze.

pacman -Sql | xargs sudo pacman -S 10 seconds later, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself with&amp;hellip; unresolvable package conflicts detected?

Everything on the 4K monitor is really really tiny! You might say, why not just apply some scaling? After all, KDE Plasma has great fraction scaling support and just worksâ„¢ on Xorg.

If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that hardcore Linux users are ridiculously obsessed about, it&amp;rsquo;s the vague and scary concept of bloat. You gotta keep package counts low, use WMs, and compile suckless.org stuff. Visit any Arch or Gentoo forum or chat, and this philosophy seems to be epidemical. But&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s a gaping problem: package count is totally irrelevant, WMs are painful to configure, and suckless.org software really sucks.</description></item><item><title>Does Windows Really Suck?</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/does-windows-really-suck/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/does-windows-really-suck/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog

Linux enthusiasts have some kind of weird obsession with Linux market share. Compound this with the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to determine accurately, with estimates ranging from lows of 0.5% to sky-high predictions like 5%. That&amp;rsquo;s a whole order of magnitude of estimates! Each end of the spectrum posits a completely different future of Linux, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started digging into this!

Cloud gaming sucks. Here&amp;rsquo;s Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s summary of its many flaws:
This approach provides several disadvantages, notably forcing the user to consistently maintain a high-speed internet connection to an external organization. This built-in barrier to entry not only locks out users who wish to play video games in areas without this internet connection, but also precludes the player from owning their personal copy of the software, and permanently locks the user into a rental agreement, tying the purchase of the game to the solvency of the streaming provider (if the company goes out of business, the game ceases to exist).</description></item><item><title>Self-hosting Sucks</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/self-hosting-sucks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/self-hosting-sucks/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
