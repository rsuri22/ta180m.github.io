Like, for real. It was a bit of hard-written HTML plus a Jekyll blog, and it was a huge pain to update and maintain. GitHub kept randomly emailing me about various security vulnerabilities in some Ruby dependency of Jekyll, and hard-written HTML can only get you so far before you rage-quit.

suckless.org really hates the web. I&amp;rsquo;ll quote them directly:
It has enabled the global information exchange, mass surveillance, studies in social control, allowed revolutions, made a fortune for many billionaires and in the meanwhile ruined our climate: the web.
There is an industry which is specialized on extending the resource usage to display just some characters on your display. Millions of jobs are based on outputting HTML in an inefficient way.</description></item></channel></rss>
