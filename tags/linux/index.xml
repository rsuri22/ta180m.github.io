Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!
First things first, let&amp;rsquo;s generate a list of all official Arch Linux packages. Fortunately, pacman, the best pragmatic package manager in existence, makes this a breeze.
pacman -Sql Great, now let&amp;rsquo;s install it all!
sudo pacman -S $(pacman -Sql) 10 seconds later, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself with&amp;hellip; unresolvable package conflicts detected?
OK, fine, let&amp;rsquo;s disable dependency checking then:
sudo pacman -Sdd $(pacman -Sql) Nope, didn&amp;rsquo;t work.

It supports my 4K 60Hz monitor out-of-the-box without any Xorg configuration or custom EDID file hackery. Even gaming on Wayland more or less works.
There&amp;rsquo;s only one problem or I would have ditched Xorg forever.
Everything on the 4K monitor is really really tiny! You might say, why not just apply some scaling? After all, KDE Plasma has great fraction scaling support and just worksâ„¢ on Xorg. The problem is that Wayland apps scale perfectly but XWayland apps&amp;hellip; not so much.</description></item><item><title>Find Deleted Matrix Messages</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/find-deleted-matrix-messages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 22:07:26 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/find-deleted-matrix-messages/</guid><description>It feels like I haven&amp;rsquo;t written a blog post in forever, and plus, I want to test Hugo&amp;rsquo;s code block formatting.

So you self-host a Matrix server, right? If not, this guide won&amp;rsquo;t be very useful. It&amp;rsquo;s still hilarious though.
If you ever get tired of ghost pings or trolls quickly deleting their Matrix messages, you can troll them right back.

KDE bloat, WMs rule. Therefore, we must use get rid of the DE in KDE and we are left with&amp;hellip; everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite WM, KWin!
There are only three easy steps. First, set up the environmental variables and start up D-Bus:
export $(dbus-launch) export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland Now enjoy your super unbloated standalone compositing Wayland window manager with kwin_wayland konsole. Need XWayland? To add that extra bloat, just pass the --xwayland flag.</description></item><item><title>Plasma 5.22 is a Disappointment</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/plasma-5.22-disappointment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/plasma-5.22-disappointment/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
The KDE Plasma update train has cycled back again to another major update, so I snatched Plasma 5.22 from the very scary testing repository, took it for a spin, and it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; disappointing.
What&amp;rsquo;s the big new feature this time? Adaptive transparency, apparently.
Adaptive what?
Yeah, if you were expecting something big, another huge leap forward, this update was anything but that. If you think panel transparency is a big deal, think again.</description></item><item><title>The Myth of Bloat</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/myth-bloat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/myth-bloat/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that hardcore Linux users are ridiculously obsessed about, it&amp;rsquo;s the vague and scary concept of bloat. You gotta keep package counts low, use WMs, and compile suckless.org stuff. Visit any Arch or Gentoo forum or chat, and this philosophy seems to be epidemical. But&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s a gaping problem: package count is totally irrelevant, WMs are painful to configure, and suckless.org software really sucks.</description></item><item><title>Does Windows Really Suck?</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/does-windows-really-suck/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/does-windows-really-suck/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
Well, obviously yes.
But recently, I heard about official support for GUI apps in WSL, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. Plus, my computer is on the Windows Insider dev channel, so I have to boot up and update Windows every few months anyways.
So I booted up Windows for the first time in a few months, and it was&amp;hellip; slow.

I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Wacom tablet for a long time now, but there&amp;rsquo;s just never been a legitimate use for it, really. Everything that I could do with the tablet, I could also do with my laptop&amp;rsquo;s touchscreen and stylus, so it always seemed like a bit of a waste. Sure, the drawing experience is a little bit better, the screen is a bit larger, but why use a Wacom tablet when the touchscreen and stylus work just fine?</description></item><item><title>Desktop Linux Revisited</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/desktop-linux-revisted/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/desktop-linux-revisted/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
Linux enthusiasts have some kind of weird obsession with Linux market share. Compound this with the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to determine accurately, with estimates ranging from lows of 0.5% to sky-high predictions like 5%. That&amp;rsquo;s a whole order of magnitude of estimates! Each end of the spectrum posits a completely different future of Linux, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started digging into this!

Cloud gaming sucks. Here&amp;rsquo;s Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s summary of its many flaws:
This approach provides several disadvantages, notably forcing the user to consistently maintain a high-speed internet connection to an external organization. This built-in barrier to entry not only locks out users who wish to play video games in areas without this internet connection, but also precludes the player from owning their personal copy of the software, and permanently locks the user into a rental agreement, tying the purchase of the game to the solvency of the streaming provider (if the company goes out of business, the game ceases to exist).</description></item><item><title>Self-hosting Sucks</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/self-hosting-sucks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/self-hosting-sucks/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
After one month of self-hosting, if there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, it&amp;rsquo;s that self-hosting sucks.

Matrix is great. It&amp;rsquo;s secure. it&amp;rsquo;s decentralized. The perfect free and open source replacement for Discord, right?
Well, there&amp;rsquo;s a few problems with this vision of the future. The first? To put it simply, no one uses Matrix. OK, maybe 100000 people use it at most, but that&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to the tens of millions of Discord users.

It&amp;rsquo;s been over a week since I&amp;rsquo;ve completed my build and switched over many things to self-hosting. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went:
It works! Remote desktop VNC works perfectly. OK, fine, I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out clipboad sharing yet, but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s perfect. I also tried Xrdp but didn&amp;rsquo;t have much luck.

WM fans, don&amp;rsquo;t kill me for saying this, but window managers suck. To see why, let&amp;rsquo;s examine the process of installing and configuring a WM.
Installing a WM OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that this step is much faster. Most WMs are only a few megabytes and take a few seconds to install, even with slow package managers like urpmi. Try installing something like KDE Plasma on Mageia or even Arch.</description></item><item><title>The Linux Office?</title><link>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/linux-office/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ta180m.github.io/posts/linux-office/</guid><description>Originally posted on my old blog
